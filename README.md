# Gene Expression Analysis specialized in nickel exposure
Nickel is the twenty-fourth most abundant chemical element on Earth, and can be found in plants, animals and even in the soil, nickel is included in the rule that says that excess is bad. Being a strong, malleable transition metal, resistant to corrosion and that mixes well with other metals, its characteristics make it widely used in the creation of the most varied objects.

At least 19 types of tumor - including lung, skin, liver, larynx, bladder and leukemias - are related to occupation and the work environment. And workers in some professions, such as hairdressers, airline pilots, flight attendants, pharmacists, chemists and nurses, are much more likely to develop these tumors.

In the published article, studies examining gene expression profiles in response to exposure to nickel compounds that were performed using in vitro tissue culture systems.

I compared the gene expression profiles in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PMCs) of eight nickel refinery workers in Jinchang, China, to the expression profiles of referring individuals with only environmental exposure.
